Aryan: HE'S GOING FOR IT! YES! AND IT'S A STRAIGHT, CLEAN OUTSIDE EDGE! OH MY GOODNESS! Neither keeper nor slip got a HAND to it! It's the SECOND of the innings! The FIRST was low from a left-hander! Round the wicket from Shawn, he's gone a bit straighter! A BAT-PAD CHANCE! WIDE of short leg! SAFRAS KHAN, so nimble in that position, went a LONG way, but I don't think he got ANYWHERE near it! A SINGLE to Phillips! 204 for FIVE NOW!
Swati: Sharma DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL! OH MY! WATCHING THE REPLAY!
Aryan: WOW! JUST WOW! AND THE TRADITIONAL HANDS UP POINTING FROM RAVINDRA! We've seen that A NUMBER of times! He continues from around the wicket! IT'S A REVERSE SWEEP ATTEMPT! OH! THAT'S GOING TO GET PAST THE DIVING SHARDUL! Moved nicely on this occasion! Just tucked backward of point down towards short third man! A SINGLE to Blundell! He goes to 31! It's 205 for the loss of FIVE! Good start for the left-arm spinner and Ashwin! New Zealand just a little bit UNCOMFORTABLE defending at this stage! Created a couple of half, well, certainly ONE full chance!
Swati: IT'S A LOFTED DRIVE OVER MID-OFF! WELL HIT! That's how he departed in the first innings! Phillips, but PLENTY of bottom hand! Chipping mid-off down to the fence for FOUR! He moves to 19! 209 for the loss of FIVE! Is that a little uppercut from you during the game, was it?!
Aryan: NO, NO, AT ALL! It's just, just, just loosening, just rubbing the hands, getting the circulation going for an OLD MAN!
Swati: "YES, YEAH! That's...
Aryan: So, hit off the over, Jeremy! One! 209 for five! BIG turning off-spinner, pitching outside of leg, going back, turning to midwicket, and there is NO RUN! The end of the over! GOOD START! Through two overs for New Zealand! They've advanced to 209 for the loss of FIVE! A couple of BIG barrel boundaries! BIG range, BIGGER deals in that four!
Swati: Phillips, one, COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING! An edge going between keeper and slip! The second, NICELY STRUCK, LIFTED! GREATLY struck drive! Not sure whether Phillips is actually picking up the length of the ball! He's moving VERY LATE and so he's still moving and hasn't got his defensive shot quite in order at the time the ball arrives and it's still moving! So that actually anything that means he does hit is going to carry further!
Aryan: JADEJA, little paddle sweep! VERY FINE! Recognizing where the gap in the field is! Deep backward square's got a LONG way to come across! SLIDING! WELL DONE, Akshar Deep! EVENTS A BOUNDARY! Blundell will come back for TWO! Scooping the ball a long way outside of off stump! 211 for FIVE! THE LEAD IS NOW 340!
Swati: "I've never thought of Tom Blundell as, um, as just a sweeper, but he's REALLY he's played it quite efficiently at times and not so at others in these two, two series that we've observed in the last sort of three or four weeks! Got out a couple of times playing the reverse sweep! I think THREE times in Sri Lanka!
Aryan: Two slips and catching around the corner! Worked nicely through midwicket off the front foot by Blundell! VERY STRONG on side player! Loves rolling the wrists and turns against the spin, but into the gap! 212 for FIVE!
Swati: '315 IS THE LEAD!
Aryan: LEAD 315! Jadeja, round the wicket again! Balls on off stump! Defending as Phillips into the cover region!
Swati: 'SLIGHTLY NERVOUS start from Phillips!
Aryan: White's back! NICE and BRIGHT! Goes back to a VERY full delivery! It's wide of off stump, so he can glide it to backward point! He likes his first sort of inclination is absolutely to go onto that back foot! There is Betty last time I was talking about trying to be on that ball of your front foot! Yeah, just short then! That's the press, isn't it?
Swati: QUICKER through the air, spearing in towards leg stump! Going down the leg side! Off hands of Phillips!
Aryan: What we mean by a forward press, you just push towards the, you know, just pushing it out with the front foot saying it's and as far as Phillips is concerned, a right hand sets his left foot! And then when you see the length, the weight's on that foot, then you can actually then force yourself back and you can go back!
Swati: 'OR GO FURTHER FORWARD!
Aryan: OR you can, that means you've got to then! He's a DRIVE that's going to squirt backward of point past the uh fielder! Deep cover point has to come around! That is Washington Sundar! So runs flowing early for New Zealand on day number three! They've added five in the most recent over! Jadeja now has none for 56! 214 for FIVE! THE LEAD IS NOW 3!"}]
